- Consumer Price Indices (CPI) measure changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for consumption. CPI numbers are widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation, as a tool by governments and central banks for inflation targeting and monitoring price stability, and as deflators in the national accounts. CPI is also used for indexing dearness allowance to employees for price increases. CPI is therefore considered one of the most important economic indicators. Two requisite components for constructing CPI numbers are weighting diagrams (consumption patterns) and price data collected at regular intervals. The data refers to group-wise All India Consumer Price Index for Rural & Urban with base year 2010. The dataset is published by the Central Statistical Office and released on the 12th of every month.
